<!--Notita:
Note that creating this object does not render the Greeting component or 
create any DOM elements.
A React element is more like a description—an instruction for React to later 
render the Greeting component. 
By returning this object from your App component, you tell React what to do 
next.
Creating elements is extremely cheap so you don’t need to try to optimize or avoid it.
